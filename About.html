  <h3>Who I Am</h3>
  <img src="images/AnikaitProfile.JPG" alt="Photo of Anikait Surakanti" width="250">
  <p>I’m Anikait Surakanti, currently studying at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business.  
    My academic path bridges technology and strategy, combining Information Systems, Business Analytics, and IT Governance.</p>
  
    <p>I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships in Technology Risk Consulting (RSM US LLP), Audit/Assurance (Forvis Mazars), and Technology Consulting (HOPE Digital Project).  
    I enjoy designing secure enterprise systems, improving IT controls, and aligning technology with business value.</p>
  
    <p>Outside of academics, I’m active in Beta Alpha Psi, the Corporate Accounting Workshop, and Design Thinking courses.  
    I’m also passionate about basketball, music production, and traveling to national parks.</p>
  
    <p>My goal is to build a career at the intersection of Cybersecurity, GRC, and Digital Transformation Consulting — helping organizations innovate safely and sustainably.</p>
