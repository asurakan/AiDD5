### Reflection  
Throughout this project, AI served primarily as a debugging and validation partner. It helped me quickly identify minor issues such as missing tags, accessibility gaps, and inconsistent styling across pages, which saved significant time compared to manual review. While AI was accurate in detecting structural and formatting errors, it occasionally made unnecessary suggestions that conflicted with the assignment’s required layout or rubric format. In those cases, I relied on my understanding of the course expectations to make the final decision. I wrote all HTML, CSS, and content independently, using AI mainly as a code reviewer and validator. This balance allowed me to strengthen my technical understanding while still leveraging AI’s efficiency for quality assurance. Overall, AI helped me focus more on design and creativity by automating repetitive checks and confirming that my final submission met professional and academic standards.
